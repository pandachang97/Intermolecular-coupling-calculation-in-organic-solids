This repository contains some utility programs that can be used to 
parameterize the Holstein Hamiltonian. For details, please see the
CalculationDetails.pptx power point presentation. 

The programs can be compiled using make and the supplied makefile.
Some of these programs rely on the lapack math library, which will
need to be installed on the machine you plan to use.

The programs analyzes calculations performed by Gaussian09, so you 
should also have access to that program for this repository  to be 
useful to you. These programs can also make input files for 
Gaussian09, please see the CalculationDetails.pptx power point 
presentation for details.

This repository also contains the input files used in the examples
in the CalculationDetails.pptx power point presentation.
